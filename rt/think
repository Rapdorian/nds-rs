I need to start settling on an API for managing graphics

Ideally, I would eventually have an API that requires very little
knowledge of specific NDS hardware to use, something like.

```rust
let lcd = nds::lcd_on();

let mut fb = BufFrameBuffer::new(lcd.top.framebuffer());
write!(fb, "Hello world");

nds::bios::stop();
```

I should also sit down and learn how the other NDS video modes work
so that I can present a unified API
